StarterSquad is a team of freelance developers who like to work on startup projects.

Startups need to develop Minimal Viable Products (MVP's) and then grow with their customer base. Hiring enough development capacity at an early stage is risky, so often the first projects are outsourced to freelancers.

These projects are often uncertain and teams change too fast for them to become the well oiled machines that they could be. This raises costs or lowers quality and thereby increases the risk that a starting company will fail to make the jump.

StarterSquad was born from such a situation, but instead of letting the team break apart they stuck together and acquired several customers to keep the team rolling. Now we are a stable team working on multiple startup ideas in rapid succession.

If you want to know how we pull this off and maybe add your idea to our backlog, give us a ping.
