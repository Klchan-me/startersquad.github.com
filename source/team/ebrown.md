Emmett Lothrop Brown
====================

Emmett refers to himself as "a student of all sciences" and is depicted as a passionate inventor. His homes in 1985 and 1955 are shown to contain various labour-saving gadgets, and he tests an intended mind-reading device on Marty, during the scene in Back to the Future when the latter visits him in 1955.

He appears to be heavily influenced by scientists of previous eras, naming successive pet dogs Copernicus and Einstein, and having portraits of Isaac Newton, Benjamin Franklin, Thomas Edison and Albert Einstein in his laboratory. He also states in Back to the Future Part III that his favorite author is Jules Verne, and reveals to Marty that his family name was originally von Braun, possibly an allusion to the real-life and contemporary rocket scientist Wernher von Braun.

Emmett is shown as absent-minded at times, and various statements by other characters inhabiting Hill Valley, the fictional setting of the series, indicate that he is regarded as strange, eccentric, or insane. He often enunciates his words with wide-eyed expressions and broad gestures—"Great Scott!" being one of the character's well-known catchphrases—and tends to be logorrheic in his delivery, referring in one case to a school dance as a "rhythmic ceremonial ritual".
